General Solution to the Nonhomogeneous Equation\n\nThe homogeneous equation is:\n\\[\n2x^2 y'' + 5x y' + y = 0\n\\]\nThe general solution to the homogeneous equation is given as:\n\\[\ny_h = \\frac{a}{x^2} + \\frac{b}{x^{1/4}}\n\\]\nThe nonhomogeneous equation is:\n\\[\n2x^2 y'' + 5x y' + y = 12x + 9\n\\]\nWe are given three possible particular solutions:\n- \\( y = x^2 - x \\)\n- \\( y = 9 + 2x \\)\n- \\( y = e^x \\)\n\nLet's check which one is a particular solution.\n\n#### Try \\( y_p = x^2 - x \\):\n\nCompute derivatives:\n\\[\ny_p' = 2x - 1\n\\]\n\\[\ny_p'' = 2\n\\]\n\nPlug into the equation:\n\\[\n2x^2 (2) + 5x (2x - 1) + (x^2 - x) = 4x^2 + 10x^2 - 5x + x^2 - x = (4x^2 + 10x^2 + x^2) + (-5x - x) = 15x^2 - 6x\n\\]\nThis is not \\(12x + 9\\).\n\n#### Try \\( y_p = 9 + 2x \\):\n\n\\[\ny_p' = 2\n\\]\n\\[\ny_p'' = 0\n\\]\n\nPlug in:\n\\[\n2x^2 (0) + 5x (2) + (9 + 2x) = 10x + 9 + 2x = 12x + 9\n\\]\nThis matches the right side! So the particular solution is \\( y_p = 9 + 2x \\).\n\nThus, the general solution to the nonhomogeneous equation is:\n\\[\ny = \\frac{a}{x^2} + \\frac{b}{x^{1/4}} + 9 + 2x\n\\]\nSo, the first [ANS] is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{a}{x^2} + \\frac{b}{x^{1/4}} + 9 + 2x}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 2. Solution with Initial Conditions\n\nGiven:\n\\[\ny(1) = 4, \\quad y'(1) = 9\n\\]\n\nLet \\( y = \\frac{a}{x^2} + \\frac{b}{x^{1/4}} + 9 + 2x \\).\n\nCompute \\( y' \\):\n\\[\ny' = -2a x^{-3} - \\frac{1}{4}b x^{-5/4} + 2\n\\]\n\nPlug in \\( x = 1 \\):\n\n\\[\ny(1) = a + b + 9 + 2 = a + b + 11 = 4 \\implies a + b = -7\n\\]\n\\[\ny'(1) = -2a - \\frac{1}{4}b + 2 = 9 \\implies -2a - \\frac{1}{4}b = 7\n\\]\n\nNow solve the system:\n\\[\na + b = -7 \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\n-2a - \\frac{1}{4}b = 7 \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\nFrom (1): \\( b = -7 - a \\)\n\nPlug into (2):\n\\[\n-2a - \\frac{1}{4}(-7 - a) = 7 \\\\\n-2a + \\frac{7}{4} + \\frac{1}{4}a = 7 \\\\\n(-2a + \\frac{1}{4}a) = 7 - \\frac{7}{4} \\\\\n(-\\frac{8}{4}a + \\frac{1}{4}a) = \\frac{21}{4} \\\\\n(-\\frac{7}{4}a) = \\frac{21}{4} \\\\\na = -3\n\\]\nThen \\( b = -7 - (-3) = -4 \\).\n\nSo the solution is:\n\\[\ny = \\frac{-3}{x^2} + \\frac{-4}{x^{1/4}} + 9 + 2x = -\\frac{3}{x^2} - \\frac{4}{x^{1/4}} + 9 + 2x\n\\]\nSo, the second [ANS] is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{-\\frac{3}{x^2} - \\frac{4}{x^{1/4}} + 9 + 2x}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 3. Wronskian of the Homogeneous Solutions\n\nThe two linearly independent solutions to the homogeneous equation are:\n\\[\ny_1 = x^{-2}, \\quad y_2 = x^{-1/4}\n\\]\n\nThe Wronskian is:\n\\[\nW(y_1, y_2) = \n\\begin{vmatrix}\ny_1 & y_2 \\\\\ny_1' & y_2'\n\\end{vmatrix}\n= y_1 y_2' - y_1' y_2\n\\]\n\nCompute derivatives:\n\\[\ny_1' = -2 x^{-3}\n\\]\n\\[\ny_2' = -\\frac{1}{4} x^{-5/4}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\\[\nW = x^{-2} \\left(-\\frac{1}{4} x^{-5/4}\\right) - (-2 x^{-3}) x^{-1/4}\n= -\\frac{1}{4} x^{-2} x^{-5/4} + 2 x^{-3} x^{-1/4}\n\\]\n\\[\n= -\\frac{1}{4} x^{-13/4} + 2 x^{-13/4}\n= \\left(-\\frac{1}{4} + 2\\right) x^{-13/4}\n= \\frac{7}{4} x^{-13/4}\n\\]\n\nSo, the third [ANS] is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{7}{4} x^{-13/4}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 4. Interval of Existence\n\nThe equation is singular at \\( x = 0 \\) (since the coefficients have \\( x \\) in the denominator). The initial condition is at \\( x = 1 \\), so the solution is valid for \\( x > 0 \\).\n\nSo, the interval is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{(0, \\infty)}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n## Final Answers\n\nThe final answers are \\boxed{\n\\frac{a}{x^2} + \\frac{b}{x^{1/4}} + 9 + 2x,\\ \n-\\frac{3}{x^2} - \\frac{4}{x^{1/4}} + 9 + 2x,\\ \n\\frac{7}{4} x^{-13/4},\\ \n(0, \\infty)\n}"

Let's check the method of undetermined coefficients more carefully.\n\nGiven the particular solution form, the only way to get \\( t^2 \\) for the polynomial part is if 0 is a double root, and the only way to get \\( t e^{2t} \\) for the exponential part is if 2 is a simple root.\n\nSo, the characteristic equation must be:\n\\[\n(r-0)^2 (r-2)^1 = r^2 (r-2)\n\\]\nExpanding:\n\\[\nr^2 (r-2) = r^3 - 2r^2\n\\]\nBut our original equation is second order, so the characteristic equation must be quadratic, not cubic.\n\nTherefore, the only way for the particular solution to have \\( t^2 \\) and \\( t e^{2t} \\) is if both 0 and 2 are roots, and 0 is a double root.\n\nSo, the characteristic equation is:\n\\[\n(r-0)^2 = r^2\n\\]\nBut then, for the \\( e^{2t} \\) part, since 2 is not a root, the particular solution would be \\( D_1 e^{2t} \\), not \\( t e^{2t} \\).\n\nAlternatively, if 2 is a root, the particular solution would be \\( D_2 t e^{2t} \\).\n\nGiven the form \\( y_p(t) = A_1 t^2 + A_0 t + B_0 t e^{2t} \\), the only way this happens is if 0 is a double root and 2 is a simple root.\n\nBut the characteristic equation is quadratic, so the only way is for the roots to be 0 and 0 (double root), or 0 and 2.\n\nIf the roots are 0 and 2, the characteristic equation is:\n\\[\n(r-0)(r-2) = r^2 - 2r\n\\]\nSo,\n\\[\n\\alpha = -\\text{(sum of roots)} = -(0+2) = -2\n\\]\n\\[\n\\beta = \\text{(product of roots)} = 0 \\times 2 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Check the form**\n\n- For the \\( t \\) on the right, since 0 is a root, the particular solution is \\( A_1 t^2 + A_0 t \\).\n- For the \\( e^{2t} \\) on the right, since 2 is a root, the particular solution is \\( B_0 t e^{2t} \\).\n\nThis matches the given form.\n\n**Step 5: Final answers**\n\n\\[\n\\alpha = -2\n\\]\n\\[\n\\beta = 0\n\\]\n\nThe final answers are \\boxed{-2,\\,0}"

Water enters the lake at a constant rate of 4 million gal/day and leaves at the same rate. An upstream manufacturer begins to discharge pollutants into the feeder stream.

[ANS] A. $8 J_{(1/2)}(x)-7 Y_{(1/2)}(x)$  B. $c_1J_{(1/2)}(x)+c_2J_{-(1/2)}(x)$  C. $c_1J_{(1/2)}(x)+c_2Y_{(1/2)}(x)$  D. $8 J_{(1/2)}(x)-7 J_{-(1/2)}(x)$  E. $c_1J_{2}(x)+c_2J_{-2}(x)$  F. $8 J_{2}(x)-7 J_{-2}(x)$\n\nAll mathematical formulas and symbols you output should be represented with LaTeX. Please end your response with: \"The final answer is \\boxed{ANSWER}\", where ANSWER should be your final answer.",
        "completion": "Let's analyze the given differential equation:\n\\[\nx^2y'' + x y' + \\left(x^2 - \\frac{1}{4}\\right)y = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is a Bessel's equation of the form:\n\\[\nx^2 y'' + x y' + (x^2 - \\nu^2) y = 0\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\nu^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\\), so \\(\\nu = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nThe general solution to Bessel's equation is:\n\\[\ny(x) = c_1 J_\\nu(x) + c_2 J_{-\\nu}(x)\n\\]\nAlternatively, since \\(J_{-\\nu}(x)\\) and \\(Y_\\nu(x)\\) are also linearly independent (for non-integer \\(\\nu\\)), another general solution is:\n\\[\ny(x) = c_1 J_\\nu(x) + c_2 Y_\\nu(x)\n\\]\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n- **A.** \\(8 J_{(1/2)}(x)-7 Y_{(1/2)}(x)\\): This is a specific linear combination of \\(J_{1/2}\\) and \\(Y_{1/2}\\), which are both solutions, so this is a solution (with specific constants).\n- **B.** \\(c_1J_{(1/2)}(x)+c_2J_{-(1/2)}(x)\\): This is the general solution in terms of Bessel functions of order \\(\\pm 1/2\\).\n- **C.** \\(c_1J_{(1/2)}(x)+c_2Y_{(1/2)}(x)\\): This is also a general solution, since \\(Y_{1/2}(x)\\) is a linear combination of \\(J_{1/2}(x)\\) and \\(J_{-1/2}(x)\\).\n- **D.** \\(8 J_{(1/2)}(x)-7 J_{-(1/2)}(x)\\): This is a specific linear combination of the general solution.\n- **E.** \\(c_1J_{2}(x)+c_2J_{-2}(x)\\): This is for \\(\\nu = 2\\), which is not the case here.\n- **F.** \\(8 J_{2}(x)-7 J_{-2}(x)\\): Again, this is for \\(\\nu = 2\\), not \\(\\nu = 1/2\\).\n\nSo, the correct options are **A, B, C, D**.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{ABCD}\\)."
