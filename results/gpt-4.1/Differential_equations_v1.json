Which solution could represent how a person learns?\n\nThe equation models learning towards a maximum of 100 (say, 100% knowledge). The solution with \\( y(0) = 30 \\) starts below 100 and approaches 100 as \\( t \\to \\infty \\), which makes sense for learning.\n\nThe solution with \\( y(0) = 125 \\) starts above 100 and decays down to 100, which is not realistic for a learning process (you can't start with more than 100% knowledge).\n\nSo, the answer is **A. \\( y(0) = 30 \\)**.\n\n---\n\nThe final answers are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{100 - 70 e^{-t},\\ 100 + 25 e^{-t},\\ A}\n\\]"

This is **unstable**.\n\n---\n\n### 3. \\( x = 0.5 \\)\n\nMultiplicity is 2 (even), so sign does **not** change.\n\nCheck just left (\\( x = 0.4 \\)), just right (\\( x = 0.6 \\)):\n\nAt \\( x = 0.4 \\):\n\n- \\( (x+2.5) = 2.9 > 0 \\)\n- \\( (x+1)^3 = 1.4^3 > 0 \\)\n- \\( (x-0.5)^2 = (-0.1)^2 = 0.01 > 0 \\)\n- \\( (x-2.5) = 0.4-2.5 = -2.1 < 0 \\)\n- Product: positive \u00d7 positive \u00d7 positive \u00d7 negative = negative.\n\nSo, \\( x' = -(\\text{negative}) = \\text{positive} \\).\n\nAt \\( x = 0.6 \\):\n\n- \\( (x+2.5) = 3.1 > 0 \\)\n- \\( (x+1)^3 = 1.6^3 > 0 \\)\n- \\( (x-0.5)^2 = (0.1)^2 = 0.01 > 0 \\)\n- \\( (x-2.5) = 0.6-2.5 = -1.9 < 0 \\)\n- Product: positive \u00d7 positive \u00d7 positive \u00d7 negative = negative.\n\nSo, \\( x' = -(\\text{negative}) = \\text{positive} \\).\n\nSo, on both sides, \\( x' > 0 \\): solutions move away from \\( x = 0.5 \\) on both sides.

(Write $t_0$ as t0 in your answer.) $v(t_0)=$ [ANS]\nHow does this compare with the solution to the equation for velocity when there is no air resistance?\nThis illustrates an important fact, related to the fundamental theorem of ODE and called 'continuous dependence' on parameters and initial conditions. What this means is that, for a fixed time, changing the initial conditions slightly, or changing the parameters slightly, only slightly changes the value at time $t$.\nThe fact that the terminal time $t$ under consideration is a fixed, finite number is important. If you consider 'infinite' $t$, or the 'final' result you may get very different answers. Consider for example a solution to $y'=y$, whose initial condition is essentially zero, but which might vary a bit positive or negative.

Since \\(v(\\xi,0) = 0\\), \\(u(x,0) = 7\\), but the IC is \\(u(x,0) = 0\\).\n\nSo, we need to adjust for the initial condition. Let's try a more general affine transformation:\n\nLet\n\\[\nu(x,t) = \\alpha v(\\xi, \\tau) + \\beta (1-\\xi) + \\gamma \\xi\n\\]\nAt \\(x=0\\) (\\(\\xi=0\\)), \\(u(0,t) = \\alpha v(0,\\tau) + \\beta\\)\nAt \\(x=6\\) (\\(\\xi=1\\)), \\(u(6,t) = \\alpha v(1,\\tau) + \\gamma\\)\n\nWe want:\n- \\(u(0,t) = 7\\) for all \\(t\\) \\(\\implies \\beta = 7\\)\n- \\(u(6,t) = 4\\) for all \\(t\\) \\(\\implies \\alpha v(1,\\tau) + \\gamma = 4\\), but \\(v(1,\\tau) = 1\\) for all \\(\\tau\\), so \\(\\alpha + \\gamma = 4\\)\n\nAt \\(t=0\\), \\(u(x,0) = \\alpha v(\\xi,0) + 7(1-\\xi) + \\gamma \\xi\\), but \\(v(\\xi,0) = 0\\), so\n\\[\nu(x,0) = 7(1-\\xi) + \\gamma \\xi\n\\]\nWe want \\(u(x,0) = 0\\) for all \\(x\\), so\n\\[\n7(1-\\xi) + \\gamma \\xi = 0 \\implies 7 - 7\\xi + \\gamma \\xi = 0 \\implies 7 + (\\gamma - 7)\\xi = 0\n\\]\nSo, \\(\\gamma = 7\\), and \\(7 = 0\\), which is not possible unless \\(7=0\\). This suggests that the initial condition is not compatible with the boundary conditions unless we allow for a nonhomogeneous solution.\n\nBut the original \\(v\\) problem has IC \\(v(\\xi,0)=0\\), BCs \\(v(0,\\tau)=0\\), \\(v(1,\\tau)=1\\).\n\nBut in the \\(u\\) problem, the IC is \\(u(x,0)=0\\), BCs \\(u(0,t)=7\\), \\(u(6,t)=4\\).\n\nThis is a standard nonhomogeneous heat equation problem. The standard trick is to write\n\\[\nu(x,t) = w(x,t) + h(x)\n\\]\nwhere \\(h(x)\\) is a steady-state solution satisfying the BCs:\n\\[\nh(0) = 7, \\quad h(6) = 4\n\\]\nand \\(w(x,t)\\) satisfies homogeneous BCs.\n\nLet \\(h(x) = 7 + (4-7)\\frac{x}{6} = 7 - \\frac{1}{2}x\\).\n\nThen,\n\\[\nu(x,t) = w(x,t) + 7 - \\frac{1}{2}x\n\\]\nNow, \\(w(x,t)\\) satisfies\n\\[\nw_t = 64 w_{xx}, \\quad w(0,t) = 0, \\quad w(6,t) = 0, \\quad w(x,0) = -h(x) = -7 + \\frac{1}{2}x\n\\]\n\nNow, the solution \\(v(\\xi,\\tau)\\) is for the problem with BCs \\(v(0,\\tau)=0\\), \\(v(1,\\tau)=1\\), IC \\(v(\\xi,0)=0\\).\n\nBut the homogeneous version (with BCs 0 at both ends) is\n\\[\n\\tilde{v}_\\tau = \\tilde{v}_{\\xi\\xi}, \\quad \\tilde{v}(0,\\tau)=0, \\quad \\tilde{v}(1,\\tau)=0, \\quad \\tilde{v}(\\xi,0) = f(\\xi)\n\\]\n\nBut our \\(w(x,t)\\) is the solution to the homogeneous heat equation with initial condition \\(-h(x)\\).\n\nBut the original \\(v\\) is for a different IC and BCs.\n\nBut we can relate \\(w(x,t)\\) to \\(v(\\xi,\\tau)\\) as follows:\n\nLet us note that the solution to the nonhomogeneous BC problem can be written as:\n\\[\nu(x,t) = (1 - \\frac{x}{6}) u(0,t) + \\frac{x}{6} u(6,t) + \\text{(homogeneous solution)}\n\\]\nBut since \\(u(0,t)=7\\), \\(u(6,t)=4\\), this is\n\\[\nu(x,t) = 7(1-\\frac{x}{6}) + 4\\frac{x}{6} + \\text{(homogeneous solution)}\n\\]\nBut the homogeneous solution is zero if the initial condition matches this steady state, but our IC is \\(u(x,0)=0\\).\n\nSo, the solution is:\n\\[\nu(x,t) = 7(1-\\frac{x}{6}) + 4\\frac{x}{6} + \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty A_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{6}\\right) e^{-64 \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{6}\\right)^2 t}\n\\]\nwhere the coefficients \\(A_n\\) are determined by the initial condition:\n\\[\nu(x,0) = 0 = 7(1-\\frac{x}{6}) + 4\\frac{x}{6} + \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty A_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{6}\\right)\n\\]\nSo,\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty A_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{6}\\right) = -7(1-\\frac{x}{6}) - 4\\frac{x}{6}\n\\]\n\nBut the question is to write \\(u(x,t)\\) in terms of \\(v(\\xi,\\tau)\\).\n\nNow, note that the solution \\(v(\\xi,\\tau)\\) is for the problem:\n\\[\nv_\\tau = v_{\\xi\\xi}, \\quad v(0,\\tau)=0, \\quad v(1,\\tau)=1, \\quad v(\\xi,0)=0\n\\]\nSo, the steady-state solution is \\(v_{ss}(\\xi) = \\xi\\), and the full solution is\n\\[\nv(\\xi,\\tau) = \\xi + \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty B_n \\sin(n\\pi \\xi) e^{-n^2\\pi^2 \\tau}\n\\]\nwith \\(v(\\xi,0) = 0\\), so\n\\[\n0 = \\xi + \\sum_{n="
