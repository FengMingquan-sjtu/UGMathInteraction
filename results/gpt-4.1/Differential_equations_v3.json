General Solution to the Nonhomogeneous Equation\n\nThe homogeneous equation is:\n\\[\n4x^2 y'' + 9x y' + y = 0\n\\]\nThe general solution to the homogeneous equation is given as:\n\\[\ny_h = \\frac{a}{x} + \\frac{b}{x^{1/4}}\n\\]\n\nA particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation\n\\[\n4x^2 y'' + 9x y' + y = 30x + 6\n\\]\nis among the options: \\( y = x^2 - x \\), \\( y = 6 + 3x \\), \\( y = e^x \\).\n\nLet's check which one works by plugging into the left side:\n\n#### Try \\( y_p = x^2 - x \\):\n\nFirst, compute derivatives:\n\\[\ny_p' = 2x - 1\n\\]\n\\[\ny_p'' = 2\n\\]\n\nPlug into the equation:\n\\[\n4x^2 (2) + 9x (2x - 1) + (x^2 - x)\n= 8x^2 + 18x^2 - 9x + x^2 - x\n= (8x^2 + 18x^2 + x^2) + (-9x - x)\n= 27x^2 - 10x\n\\]\nBut the right side is \\( 30x + 6 \\), so this is not a solution.\n\n#### Try \\( y_p = 6 + 3x \\):\n\n\\[\ny_p' = 3\n\\]\n\\[\ny_p'' = 0\n\\]\n\nPlug in:\n\\[\n4x^2 (0) + 9x (3) + (6 + 3x)\n= 27x + 6 + 3x\n= 27x + 6 + 3x = 30x + 6\n\\]\nThis matches the right side!

Researchers are therefore interested in understanding the protective role of natural antioxidants. In the study of one such antioxidant (Hsian-tsao leaf gum), the antioxidation activity of the substance has been found to depend on concentration in the following way:\n \\frac{dA(c)}{dc} =k[L-A(c)], \\ \\ \\ A(0)=0. In this equation, the dependent variable $A$ is a quantitative measure of antioxidant activity at concentration $c$. The constant $L$ represents a limiting or equilibrium value of this activity, and $k$ a positive rate constant.\nLet $B(c)=A(c)-L$ and reformulate the given initial value problem in terms of this new dependent variable, $B$.\n$  \\frac{dB(c)}{dc} =$ [ANS]\n$B(0)=$ [ANS]\nSolve the new initial value problem for $B(c)$ and then determine the quantity $A(c)$.\n$A(c)=$ [ANS]\nDoes the activity $A(c)$ ever exceed the value $L$?

Formula for the rate of deposits and withdrawals, $g(t)$\n\n> Money is added and withdrawn from the account at a rate which follows a sinusoidal pattern, peaking in January and in July with money being added at a rate corresponding to $1730$ dollars per year, while maximum withdrawals take place at the rate of $550$ dollars per year in April and October.\n\nThis means the net rate is a sinusoidal function with period 1 year (since $t$ is in years).\n\n- The **maximum deposit** is $1730$ dollars/year (in January and July).\n- The **maximum withdrawal** is $550$ dollars/year (in April and October).\n\nThis suggests a function of the form:\n\\[\ng(t) = A + B \\cos(2\\pi t)\n\\]\nwhere $A$ is the average rate, and $B$ is the amplitude.\n\nBut let's check the timing:\n- **January ($t=0$):** maximum deposit ($+1730$)\n- **April ($t=1/4$):** maximum withdrawal ($-550$)\n- **July ($t=1/2$):** maximum deposit ($+1730$)\n- **October ($t=3/4$):** maximum withdrawal ($-550$)\n\nSo, the function alternates between $+1730$ and $-550$ every quarter year.\n\nLet\u2019s write $g(t) = a + b \\cos(4\\pi t)$, since the period is half a year (since it peaks twice a year).\n\nLet\u2019s check:\n- At $t=0$: $\\cos(0) = 1 \\implies g(0) = a + b$\n- At $t=1/4$: $\\cos(\\pi) = -1 \\implies g(1/4) = a - b$\n- At $t=1/2$: $\\cos(2\\pi) = 1 \\implies g(1/2) = a + b$\n- At $t=3/4$: $\\cos(3\\pi) = -1 \\implies g(3/4) = a - b$\n\nSo, $a + b = 1730$, $a - b = -550$.\n\nSolving:\n\\[\na + b = 1730 \\\\\na - b = -550 \\\\\n\\implies 2a = 1180 \\implies a = 590 \\\\\nb = 1730 - 590 = 1140\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\\[\ng(t) = 590 + 1140 \\cos(4\\pi t)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{590 + 1140 \\cos(4\\pi t)}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 3.

General solution for $y(t)$\n\nWe solve:\n\\[\ny' - 0.05y = 590 + 1140 \\cos(4\\pi t)\n\\]\n\nThis is a linear ODE. The integrating factor is $e^{-0.05 t}$.\n\nThe general solution is:\n\\[\ny(t) = e^{0.05 t} \\left[ C + \\int_0^t e^{-0.05 s} (590 + 1140 \\cos(4\\pi s)) ds \\right]\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s compute the integral:\n\\[\n\\int e^{-0.05 s} (590 + 1140 \\cos(4\\pi s)) ds = 590 \\int e^{-0.05 s} ds + 1140 \\int e^{-0.05 s} \\cos(4\\pi s) ds\n\\]\n\nFirst term:\n\\[\n590 \\int e^{-0.05 s} ds = -11800 e^{-0.05 s}\n\\]\n\nSecond term:\n\\[\n\\int e^{-a s} \\cos(\\omega s) ds = \\frac{e^{-a s}}{a^2 + \\omega^2} (a \\cos(\\omega s) + \\omega \\sin(\\omega s))\n\\]\nHere, $a = 0.05$, $\\omega = 4\\pi$.\n\nSo,\n\\[\n\\int e^{-0.05 s} \\cos(4\\pi s) ds = \\frac{e^{-0.05 s}}{(0.05)^2 + (4\\pi)^2} (0.05 \\cos(4\\pi s) + 4\\pi \\sin(4\\pi s))\n\\]\n\nSo, the indefinite integral is:\n\\[\n590 \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{0.05}\\right) e^{-0.05 s} + 1140 \\cdot \\frac{e^{-0.05 s}}{(0.05)^2 + (4\\pi)^2} (0.05 \\cos(4\\pi s) + 4\\pi \\sin(4\\pi s))\n\\]\n\nBut for the definite integral from $0$ to $t$, we have:\n\\[\n\\int_0^t e^{-0.05 s} (590 + 1140 \\cos(4\\pi s)) ds = \\left[ -11800 e^{-0.05 s} + 1140 \\cdot \\frac{e^{-0.05 s}}{(0.05)^2 + (4\\pi)^2} (0.05 \\cos(4\\pi s) + 4\\pi \\sin(4\\pi s)) \\right]_0^t\n\\]\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\\[\ny(t) = e^{0.05 t} \\left[ C + F(t) \\right]\n\\]\nwhere\n\\[\nF(t) = \\left[ -11800 e^{-0.05 s} + 1140 \\cdot \\frac{e^{-0.05 s}}{(0.05)^2 + (4\\pi)^2} (0.05 \\cos(4\\pi s) + 4\\pi \\sin(4\\pi s)) \\right]_0^t\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\\[\nF(t) = \\left( -11800 e^{-0.05 t} + 1140 \\cdot \\frac{e^{-0.05 t}}{(0.05)^2 + (4\\pi)^2} (0.05 \\cos(4\\pi t) + 4\\pi \\sin(4\\pi t)) \\right) \\\\\n- \\left( -11800 + 1140 \\cdot \\frac{1}{(0.05)^2 + (4\\pi)^2} (0.05 \\cdot 1 + 0) \\right)\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s write $D = (0.05)^2 + (4\\pi)^2 = 0.0025 + 16\\pi^2 \\approx 0.0025 + 157.9137 \\approx 157.9162$\n\nSo,\n\\[\ny(t) = e^{0.05 t} \\left[ C -11800 (e^{-0.05 t} - 1) + 1140 \\left( \\frac{e^{-0.05 t} (0.05 \\cos(4\\pi t) + 4\\pi \\sin(4\\pi t)) - 0.05}{157.9162} \\right) \\right]\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\ny(t) = e^{0.05 t} \\left[ C -11800 (e^{-0.05 t} - 1) + 1140 \\left( \\frac{e^{-0.05 t} (0.05 \\cos(4\\pi t) + 4\\pi \\sin(4\\pi t)) - 0.05}{157.9162} \\right) \\right]\n}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 5. Amount in the bank at the beginning of January 2000 ($t=10$)\n\nWe need to use the initial condition $y(0) = 1620$ to solve for $C$.\n\nAt $t=0$:\n\\[\ny(0) = C -11800 (1 - 1) + 1140 \\left( \\frac{(0.05 \\cdot 1 + 0) - 0.05}{157.9162} \\right) = C + 1140 \\cdot 0 = C\n\\]\nSo $C = 1620$.\n\nNow, plug $t=10$ into the formula:\n\nFirst, $e^{0.05 \\cdot 10} = e^{0.5} \\approx 1.64872$\n\n$e^{-0.05 \\cdot 10} = e^{-0.5} \\approx 0.60653$\n\n$\\cos(4\\pi \\"

But above, we used \\( \\tau = t/36 \\). Let's check carefully:\n      - \\( u_t = 16 u_{xx} \\)\n      - Let \\( \\tau = \\alpha t \\), \\( \\xi = x/6 \\)\n      - \\( u_t = \\alpha v_\\tau \\)\n      - \\( u_{xx} = \\frac{1}{36} v_{\\xi\\xi} \\)\n      - So \\( \\alpha v_\\tau = 16 \\cdot \\frac{1}{36} v_{\\xi\\xi} \\implies v_\\tau = \\frac{16}{36\\alpha} v_{\\xi\\xi} \\)\n      - To get \\( v_\\tau = v_{\\xi\\xi} \\), set \\( \\alpha = 16/36 = 4/9 \\implies \\tau = \\frac{4}{9} t \\)\n    - So the correct scaling is \\( \\tau = \\frac{4}{9} t \\).\n\n### Step 2: Adjust for Boundary Conditions\n\nThe reference solution has \\( v(0,\\tau) = 0 \\), \\( v(1,\\tau) = 1 \\), but our problem has \\( u(0,t) = 3 \\), \\( u(6,t) = 8 \\).\n\nLet us write\n\\[\nu(x,t) = a(x) + b(x) v(\\xi, \\tau)\n\\]\nwhere \\( a(x) \\) and \\( b(x) \\) are chosen so that the boundary conditions are satisfied.\n\nLet us try:\n\\[\nu(x,t) = (1 - \\xi) u(0,t) + \\xi u(6,t) + [u(x,t) - ((1-\\xi)u(0,t) + \\xi u(6,t))]\n\\]\nBut more simply, since \\( v(\\xi, \\tau) \\) goes from 0 at \\( \\xi=0 \\) to 1 at \\( \\xi=1 \\), and initial condition is 0, we can write:\n\\[\nu(x,t) = 3 + (8-3) v\\left( \\frac{x}{6}, \\frac{4}{9} t \\right)\n\\]\nand check:\n- At \\( x=0 \\), \\( \\xi=0 \\), \\( v(0,\\tau)=0 \\implies u(0,t) = 3 \\)\n- At \\( x=6 \\), \\( \\xi=1 \\), \\( v(1,\\tau)=1 \\implies u(6,t) = 3 + 5 = 8 \\)\n- At \\( t=0 \\), \\( \\tau=0 \\), \\( v(\\xi,0)=0 \\implies u(x,0) = 3 \\) (but our IC is \\( u(x,0)=0 \\)). So we need to adjust for this.\n\nLet us try a more general affine transformation:\n\\[\nu(x,t) = A(x) + B(x) v\\left( \\frac{x}{6}, \\frac{4}{9} t \\right)\n\\]\nBut we need \\( u(x,0) = 0 \\), so at \\( t=0 \\), \\( v(\\xi,0)=0 \\), so \\( u(x,0) = A(x) \\implies A(x) = 0 \\).\n\nSo, \\( u(x,t) = B(x) v\\left( \\frac{x}{6}, \\frac{4}{9} t \\right) \\).\n\nBut then at \\( x=0 \\), \\( u(0,t) = B(0) v(0,\\tau) = 0 \\), but we want \\( u(0,t) = 3 \\). So this doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, let's try:\n\\[\nu(x,t) = f(x) + g(x) v\\left( \\frac{x}{6}, \\frac{4}{9} t \\right)\n\\]\nAt \\( t=0 \\), \\( v=0 \\implies u(x,0) = f(x) = 0 \\implies f(x) = 0 \\).\n\nSo \\( u(x,t) = g(x) v\\left( \\frac{x}{6}, \\frac{4}{9} t \\right) \\).\n\nAt \\( x=0 \\), \\( u(0,t) = g(0) v(0,\\tau) = 0 \\), but we want \\( u(0,t) = 3 \\).\n\nSo, the only way is to shift the solution by a steady-state solution that satisfies the boundary conditions, and then use the homogeneous problem for the rest.\n\nLet us write:\n\\[\nu(x,t) = h(x) + w(x,t)\n\\]\nwhere \\( h(x) \\) is the steady-state solution (\\( u_t = 0 \\)), i.e., \\( 16 h''(x) = 0 \\), \\( h(0) = 3 \\), \\( h(6) = 8 \\).\n\nSo \\( h(x) = 3 + \\frac{5}{6} x \\).\n\nNow, \\( w(x,t) \\) satisfies:\n\\[\nw_t = 16 w_{xx}, \\quad w(0,t) = 0, \\quad w(6,t) = 0, \\quad w(x,0) = -h(x)\n\\]\n\nNow, the reference solution \\( v(\\xi, \\tau) \\) is for the problem with \\( v(0,\\tau) = 0 \\), \\( v(1,\\tau) = 1 \\), \\( v(\\xi,0) = 0 \\).\n\nBut for the homogeneous problem, we can write:\n\\[\nw(x,t) = [8-3] v\\left( \\frac{x}{6}, \\frac{4}{9} t \\right) - h(x) v\\left( \\frac{x}{6}, \\frac{4}{9} t \\right)\n\\]\nBut this is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, since the reference solution is for a nonhomogeneous boundary, but our homogeneous part is for zero boundary, we need to relate the two.\n\nBut, the solution to the original problem is:\n\\[\nu(x,t) = 3 + \\frac{5}{6} x + \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty A_n \\sin\\left( \\frac{n\\pi x}{6} \\right) e^{-16 \\left( \\frac{n\\pi}{6} \\right)^2 t }\n\\]\nBut the reference solution is for \\( v(\\xi, \\tau) \\) with \\( v(0,\\tau) = 0 \\), \\( v(1,\\tau) = 1 \\), \\( v(\\xi,0) = 0 \\).\n\nBut, the general solution for the nonhomogeneous boundary is:\n\\[\nv(\\xi,"
