The reference answer uses a different amplitude and frequency (cosine with \\( 4\\pi t \\)), and includes a constant offset. The student's answer uses a sum of cosine and sine with frequency \\( 2\\pi t \\) and no offset.

The forms are not equivalent.\n\n5. **Amount in January 2000 (\\( t=10 \\))**:  \n   - Student: \\( 1714 \\)\n   - Reference: \\( 12181.9247740871 \\)\n   \n   The values are not close; the student's answer is off by an order of magnitude, indicating a significant error in the model or calculation.\n\n6. **Steady-State Solution**:  \n   - Student: \\( A \\cos(2\\pi t) + B \\sin(2\\pi t) \\)\n   - Reference: \\( -\\frac{850}{0.04} - 0.271031 \\cos(4\\pi t) + 85.147 \\sin(4\\pi t) \\)\n   \n   The student gives a general form with undetermined coefficients and the wrong frequency, while the reference answer gives a specific, fully determined solution with the correct frequency and a constant term.\n\n7. **Final Value**:  \n   - Both answers give \\( 3 \\). This is correct.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe student only matches the reference answer in the first and last parts. For all other parts, the student uses a different model (wrong frequency, missing constant offset, undetermined coefficients), and the numerical answers do not match. Therefore, the student's answer is not mathematically or notationally equivalent to the reference answer.\n\n=== report over ==="

Here are the main discrepancies:\n\n1. **Order and Content of Early Entries:**  \n   - The reference answer begins with \\(0, 3, 9 e^{-st}, 3, \\infty, 3 t e^{-st}, 3 t, \\ldots\\), while the student's answer starts with \\(9, 0, 3, 3, 3, \\infty, t e^{-st}, t, \\ldots\\). The order and the specific expressions do not align.\n   - For example, the reference answer's third entry is \\(9 e^{-st}\\), but the student's is \\(3\\).\n\n2. **Missing or Incorrect Multiplicative Constants:**  \n   - The reference answer often includes multiplicative constants (such as \\(3\\) or \\(9\\)) in front of terms like \\(e^{-st}\\) or \\(dt\\), which are missing or misplaced in the student's answer. For instance, the reference answer has \\(3 t e^{-st}\\) and \\(3 t\\), but the student writes \\(t e^{-st}\\) and \\(t\\) without the factor of 3.\n\n3. **Integration Limits and Expressions:**  \n   - The reference answer uses expressions like \\(-\\frac{9}{s} e^{-st}\\) and \\(\\frac{3 t e^{-st}}{s}\\), while the student writes \\(-\\frac{1}{s} e^{-st}\\) and \\(t e^{-st}\\), missing the necessary coefficients.\n\n4. **Final Laplace Transform Expression:**  \n   - The reference answer's final boxed entry is \\(\\frac{9}{s} + e^{-3s} \\left[ -\\frac{9}{s} + \\frac{9}{s} + \\frac{3}{s^2} \\right]\\), which simplifies to \\(\\frac{9}{s} + \\frac{3}{s^2} e^{-3s}\\). The student writes \\(\\frac{9}{s} + \\frac{3}{s^2} e^{-3s}\\), which is correct for the final value, but the process and intermediate boxed answers do not match the reference answer's required sequence.\n\n5. **Order and Structure:**  \n   - The reference answer is structured to match the step-by-step process of the Laplace transform calculation, with each boxed answer corresponding to a specific step. The student's answer does not follow this structure and order, making it notationally and mathematically non-equ"

This difference is minor and within the acceptable error tolerance.\n\n2. **Exact Solution:**\n   - The student writes the exact solution as \\( \\ln(t^2 + e^3) \\), while the reference answer writes \\( \\ln(1 \\cdot t^2 + 20.0855) \\). Since \\( e^3 \\approx 20.0855 \\), these are mathematically equivalent expressions for the exact solution. The difference in form is acceptable.\n\n3. **Error Calculations:**\n   - The student\u2019s error values are \\( 0.00423, 0.00721, 0.00884 \\), while the reference answer gives \\( 0.00198767, 0.00584558, 0.00930269 \\). These values differ by more than the allowed relative error of \\( 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\). For example, for \\( t = 0.2 \\):\n     - Reference: 0.00198767\n     - Student: 0.00423\n     - Relative error: \\( \\frac{0.00423 - 0.00198767}{0.00198767} \\approx 1.13 \\), which is much greater than the allowed tolerance.\n   - This indicates that the student either used different values for the exact solution or made a calculation error in the error computation.\n\nBecause the error values are not within the required tolerance, the student\u2019s answer is not fully correct, even though the method and most of the values are close.

The most significant error is in the classification of the last equation, where the homogeneity is misidentified.\n\nTherefore, the student's answer is not equivalent to the reference answer.\n\n=== report over ==="

For the differential equation in T use the C and D.For the variable $\\lambda$ type the word lambda and type alpha for $\\alpha$,otherwise treat them as you would any other variable.\nUse the prime notation for derivatives, so the derivative of $X$ is written as $X^\\prime$. Do NOT use $X^\\prime(x)$\nThe longitudinal displacement u(x,t) of a vibrating elastic bar can be modeled by a wave equation with free-end conditions\n a^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} , 0< x < L, t > 0   \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\Big\\vert_{x=0}=0,  \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\Big\\vert_{x=L}=0, t > 0  u(x,0)=x   \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} \\Big\\vert_{t=0}=-3,0<x<L\nPART 1: Separate\nWe look for solutions of the form $u(x,t)=X(x)T(t)$. Assuming solutions of this form the PDE can be written as [ANS]=[ANS]\nThen we can separate the PDE,placing constants in the DE into T: [ANS]=[ANS]=$-\\lambda$ ($\\lambda$ is typed as lambda) The boundary conditions in the PDE translate into initial conditions for the differential equation in X: Since these differential equations are independent of each other, they can be separated DE in X: [ANS] $=0$ IC's in X:\n$X^\\prime($ [ANS] $)=$ [ANS]\n$X^\\prime($ [ANS] $)=$ [ANS]\nDE in T: [ANS] $=0$\nThis leads us to a Sturm-Louiville problem in X. In each case the general solution in X is written with constants A and B.\nPART 2: Solve for X\nCase 1: $\\lambda=0$ $X(x)=$ [ANS]\nUsing this formula\n$X^\\prime(0)=$ [ANS] $=0$ $X^\\prime(L)=$ [ANS] $=0$ Making X a constant function. We get the constant solution another way, so we will discard this case.\nCase 2: $\\lambda=-\\alpha^2$ $X(x)=$ [ANS]\n$X^\\prime(0)=$ [ANS] $=0$ That simplifies X down to [ANS]. Using the simplified X: $X^\\prime(L)=$ [ANS] $=0$\nTherefore $A=$ [ANS] and $X=$ [ANS]\nCase 3: $\\lambda=\\alpha^2$ $X(x)=$ [ANS]\n$X^\\prime(0)=$ [ANS] $=0$ So X simplifies to [ANS]. Using the simplified X: $X^\\prime(L)=$ [ANS] $=0$ Which leads us to the eigenvalues $\\lambda=$ [ANS]\nNote If n=0 we get the constant case from $\\lambda=0$, including it would have been redundant.\nPART 3: Solve for T\nSo the only case we need consider is the $\\lambda=\\alpha^2$ case. Therefore the differential equation in T is now [ANS] $=0$ which has the general solution (using C and D as the unknown constants) $T=$ [ANS]\nPART 4: Find the series solution\nSince the constant from the $\\cos\\!\\left( \\frac{n\\pi x}{L} \\right)$ term would be redundant, functions of the form $u(x,t)=X(x)T(t)=$ [ANS], for $n\\geq 0$, are solutions of the PDE  a^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} , 0< x < L, t > 0   \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\Big\\vert_{x=0}=0,  \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\Big\\vert_{x=L}=0, t > 0 To add in the initial conditions we will have to use a series solution.

Here are the main discrepancies:\n\n1. **Notational and Variable Differences**: The reference answer uses simplified notations such as \\( X \\), \\( T \\), and omits explicit arguments (e.g., \\( X(x) \\) vs. \\( X \\)), while the student uses more explicit forms (e.g., \\( X(x)T(t) \\)). While this is not a problem in itself, the reference answer also omits derivatives in some places, whereas the student includes them (e.g., \\( a^2 X''(x)T(t) \\) vs. \\( a^2 X \\)). This is a notational mismatch.\n\n2. **Boundary/Initial Conditions**: The reference answer includes values like \\( L \\) and \\( T \\) for certain boundary/initial conditions, but the student writes \\( 0 \\) in those places. For example, for [ANS 8] and [ANS 9], the reference answer is \\( L \\) and \\( 0 \\), but the student writes \\( 0 \\) for both. This is a substantive mathematical difference.\n\n3. **General Solution Forms**: For the general solution in the case \\( \\lambda = -\\alpha^2 \\), the reference answer uses hyperbolic functions (\\( \\cosh \\), \\( \\sinh \\)), while the student writes the solution in terms of exponentials and only later simplifies to hyperbolic functions. However, the boxed answer for [ANS 15] is \\("

The PDE can be rewritten using this solution as (placing constants in the DE for Y) into [ANS]=[ANS]=$-\\lambda$\nNote: Use the prime notation for derivatives, so the derivative of $X$ is written as $X^\\prime$. Do NOT use $X^\\prime(x)$\nSince these differential equations are independent of each other, they can be separated DE in X: [ANS] $=0$ DE in Y: [ANS] $=0$\nNow we solve the separate separated ODEs for the different cases in $\\lambda$. In each case the general solution in X is written with constants a and b and the general solution in Y is written with constants c and d. Write the functions alphabetically, so that if the solutions involve cos and sin, your answer would be acos(x)+bsin(x). Case 1: $\\lambda=0$ $X(x)=$ [ANS]\n$Y(y)=$ [ANS]\nDE in Y If $\\lambda\\neq 0$, the differential equation in Y is first order, linear, and more importantly separable. We separate the two sides as [ANS]=[ANS]\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $y$ (placing the constant of integration c in the right hand side) we get [ANS]=[ANS]\nSolving for Y, using the funny algebra of constant where $e^c=c$ is just another constant we get $Y=$ [ANS]\nFor $\\lambda\\neq 0$ we get a Sturm-Louiville problem in X which we need to handle two more cases Case 2: $\\lambda=-\\alpha^2$ $X(x)=$ [ANS]\nCase 3: $\\lambda=\\alpha^2$ $X(x)=$ [ANS]\nFinal Solution Case 1: $\\lambda=0$ $u=$ [ANS]\nCase 2: $\\lambda=-\\alpha^2$ $u=$ [ANS]\nCase 3: $\\lambda=\\alpha^2$ $u=$ [ANS]\n\nAll mathematical formulas and symbols you output should be represented with LaTeX.

This is acceptable.\n\n2. **Separation Constant**: The student uses \\( -\\lambda \\), which matches the reference answer.\n\n3. **ODEs for \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\)**: The student writes \\( k^2 X'' + \\lambda X \\) and \\( y^2 Y' + \\lambda Y \\), which are correct.\n\n4. **Independence**: The student writes \"True,\" which is a reasonable answer to the independence question.\n\n5. **Case \\( \\lambda = 0 \\)**: The student gives \\( a x + b \\) for \\( X(x) \\) and \\( c \\) for \\( Y(y) \\), matching the reference answer.\n\n6. **Separation for \\( Y \\) when \\( \\lambda \\neq 0 \\)**: The student writes \\( \\frac{Y'}{Y} = -\\frac{\\lambda}{y^2} \\), which is correct.\n\n7. **Integration**: The student writes \\( \\ln Y = \\frac{\\lambda}{y} + c \\), but the reference answer is \\( \\ln|Y| = -\\lambda k^2 / (-1) y^{-1} + C \\). The student omits the \\( k^2 \\) factor and the sign, which is significant. The reference answer includes \\( k^2 \\) in the exponent, which is missing from the student's answer.\n\n8. **General Solution for \\( Y \\)**: The student writes \\( c e^{\\frac{\\lambda}{y}} \\), but the reference answer is \\( c e^{\\lambda k^2 y^{-1}} \\). Again, the student omits the \\( k^2 \\) factor.\n\n9. **General Solution for \\( X(x) \\)**: The student gives \\( a e^{\\frac{\\alpha}{k} x} + b e^{-\\frac{\\alpha}{k} x} \\) and \\( a \\cos(\\frac{\\alpha}{k} x) + b \\sin(\\frac{\\alpha}{k} x) \\), while the reference answer uses \\( a \\cosh(\\alpha x) + b \\sinh(\\alpha x) \\) and \\( a \\cos(\\alpha x) + b \\sin(\\alpha x) \\).
