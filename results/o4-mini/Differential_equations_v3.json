Newton's law of cooling says that $T(t)$ changes at a rate proportional to the difference between the temperature of the environment and the temperature of the artifact. This says that there is a constant $k$, not dependent on time, such that $T'=k(E-T)$, where $E$ is the temperature of the environment (the oven).\nBefore collecting the artifact from the desert, Susan measured its temperature at a couple of times, and she has determined that for the alien artifact, $k=0.7$.\nSusan preheats her oven to $80$ degrees Fahrenheit (she has stubbornly refused to join the metric world). At time $t=0$ the oven is at exactly $80$ degrees and is heating up, and the oven runs through a temperature cycle every $2 \\pi$ minutes, in which its temperature varies by $30$ degrees above and $30$ degrees below $80$ degrees.\nLet $E(t)$ be the temperature of the oven after $t$ minutes. $E(t)=$ [ANS]\nAt time $t=0$, when the artifact is at a temperature of $45$ degrees, she puts it in the oven.

Their answer types are, in order, an expression, a numerical value without units, an expression, an expression, a numerical value without units, a numerical value without units.\n\nProblem:\nSusan finds an alien artifact in the desert, where there are temperature variations from a low in the 30s at night to a high in the 100s in the day. She is interested in how the artifact will respond to faster variations in temperature, so she kidnaps the artifact, takes it back to her lab (hotly pursued by the military police who patrol Area 51), and sticks it in an \"oven\"--that is, a closed box whose temperature she can control precisely.\nLet $T(t)$ be the temperature of the artifact. Newton's law of cooling says that $T(t)$ changes at a rate proportional to the difference between the temperature of the environment and the temperature of the artifact. This says that there is a constant $k$, not dependent on time, such that $T'=k(E-T)$, where $E$ is the temperature of the environment (the oven).\nBefore collecting the artifact from the desert, Susan measured its temperature at a couple of times, and she has determined that for the alien artifact, $k=0.7$.\nSusan preheats her oven to $80$ degrees Fahrenheit (she has stubbornly refused to join the metric world). At time $t=0$ the oven is at exactly $80$ degrees and is heating up, and the oven runs through a temperature cycle every $2 \\pi$ minutes, in which its temperature varies by $30$ degrees above and $30$ degrees below $80$ degrees.\nLet $E(t)$ be the temperature of the oven after $t$ minutes. $E(t)=$ [ANS]\nAt time $t=0$, when the artifact is at a temperature of $45$ degrees, she puts it in the oven. Let $T(t)$ be the temperature of the artifact at time $t$. Then $T(0)=$ [ANS] (degrees)\nWrite a differential equation which models the temperature of the artifact. $T'=f(t, T)=$ R2 R2. Note: Use $T$ rather than $T(t)$ since the latter confuses the computer. Don't enter units for this equation.\nSolve the differential equation. To do this, you may find it helpful to know that if $a$ is a constant, then\n\\int \\sin(t)e^{at} dt= \\frac{1}{a^{2} +1} e^{at} (a \\sin(t)-\\cos(t))+C. $T(t)=$ [ANS]\nAfter Susan puts in the artifact in the oven, the military police break in and take her away. Think about what happens to her artifact as $t \\rightarrow \\infty$ and fill in the following sentence:\nFor large values of $t$, even though the oven temperature varies between 50 and 110 degrees, the artifact varies from [ANS] to [ANS] degrees.\n\nAll mathematical formulas and symbols you output should be represented with LaTeX.

This is a minor rounding, but the problem statement does not specify the required precision. However, the more significant issue is the form: the reference answer uses \\( 14.09396(0.7\\sin(t) - \\cos(t)) \\), while the student splits this as \\( 14.09\\sin(t) - 14.09\\cos(t) \\). This is only equivalent if \\( 0.7\\sin(t) - \\cos(t) = \\sin(t) - \\cos(t) \\), which is not true.

The error in the trigonometric coefficients and the lack of precision in the extrema make the answer incorrect.\n\n=== report over ==="

Unless the problem explicitly asks for a rounded or decimal answer, the boxed answer should match the form of the reference answer. Since the student provided a decimal instead of the exact form, the answer is not fully equivalent.\n\nTherefore, the student's answer is not fully correct due to the mismatch in the required form for part (b).\n\n=== report over ==="

This is a factor of 10 difference, which is a significant error.\n\n  Additionally, the reference answer omits the Heaviside term, suggesting it is only for \\(0 \\leq t < 1\\), while the student's answer is for all \\(t\\). However, even for \\(0 \\leq t < 1\\), the coefficient mismatch for the \\(\\sin 4t\\) term means the answers are not equivalent.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The first boxed answer (\\(Y(s)\\)) is equivalent to the reference answer.\n- The second"

The Heaviside function arguments are reversed in sign, which fundamentally changes the intervals on which the function is nonzero. Specifically:\n\n- \\( h(t-2) \\) is 0 for \\( t < 2 \\) and 1 for \\( t \\geq 2 \\).\n- \\( h(6-t) \\) is 1 for \\( t < 6 \\) and 0 for \\( t \\geq 6 \\).\n\nThus, \\( h(t-2) - h(t-6) \\) is 1 for \\( 2 \\leq t < 6 \\), and 0 otherwise, while \\( h(6-t) - h(2-t) \\) is 1 for \\( t < 2 \\), -1 for \\( t > 6 \\), and 0 for \\( 2 \\leq t < 6 \\). The two expressions are not equivalent, and the student's answer does not match the reference answer.\n\n=== report over ==="

The student's answer, while containing many correct expressions, does not match the order or the exact content of the reference answer. For example, the reference answer starts with the limits \\(0, 7\\) and the integrand \\(6 e^{-st}\\), while the student writes \\(6, 0^7, e^{-st}\\), which is a different order and format.\n\n2. **Coefficients and Expressions:** The reference answer includes coefficients with the integrands (e.g., \\(6 e^{-st}\\), \\(4 t e^{-st}\\)), while the student separates the coefficients and the integrands (e.g., \\(6, 0^7, e^{-st}\\)). This separation can lead to ambiguity and does not strictly follow the format of the reference answer.\n\n3. **Limits and Notation:** The reference answer uses clear notation for limits (e.g., \\(0, 7\\)), while the student uses \\(0^7\\), which is not standard and could be misinterpreted.\n\n4. **Final Expressions:** The final expressions in the reference answer are more compact and combine terms appropriately, such as \\(\\frac{6}{s} + e^{-7s} \\left( -\\frac{6}{s} + \\frac{28}{s} + \\frac{4}{s^2} \\right)\\), whereas the student writes \\(\\frac{6}{s} + \\frac{28}{s} e^{-7s} + \\frac{4}{s^2} e^{-7s}\\) and \\(\\frac{6}{s} + \\left( \\frac{22}{s} + \\frac{4}{s^2} \\right) e^{-7s}\\). While these are algebraically equivalent, the order and grouping do not match the reference answer's placeholders.\n\n5. **Missing or Extra Placeholders:** The student includes some expressions (e.g., \\(t, e^{-st} dt, dt\\)) that do not directly correspond to the reference answer's placeholders, and omits or rearranges others.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBecause the student's answer does not match the order, grouping, or exact content of the reference answer's placeholders, and because the problem requires precise matching of stepwise"

This is a significant mathematical difference, as the presence of \\( k^2 \\) changes the scaling and behavior of the solutions.\n\n2. **Hyperbolic vs. Exponential/Circular Functions:**  \n   - The reference answer uses hyperbolic functions (\\( \\cosh \\), \\( \\sinh \\)) for the case \\( \\lambda = -\\alpha^2 \\), while the student uses exponentials (\\( e^{\\frac{\\alpha}{k} x} \\)), which is mathematically equivalent. However, the argument of the exponentials in the student's answer is \\( \\frac{\\alpha}{k} x \\), while the reference answer uses \\( \\alpha x \\). This is only equivalent if \\( \\alpha \\) is redefined, but the reference answer's notation is more consistent with the separation constant as \\( \\lambda = -\\alpha^2 k^2 \\).\n   - Similarly, for the trigonometric case, the student uses \\( \\frac{\\alpha}{k} x \\) instead of \\( \\alpha x \\).\n\n3. **Order and Notation:**  \n   - The order of the answers is mostly consistent, but the notational differences (especially the missing \\( k^2 \\) factors) are not minor; they fundamentally change the form and correctness of the separated solutions.\n\n4. **Constants and Integration:**  \n   - The reference answer uses \\( \\ln|Y| \\) and \\( -\\frac{\\lambda k^2}{-3} y^{-3} + C \\), while the student uses \\( \\ln Y \\) and \\( \\int -\\frac{\\lambda}{y^4"

        "prompt": "User: The following is an undergraduate-level mathematical problem in Differential_equations. You need to solve the problem by completing all placeholders [ANS].\n\nThis problem involves 9 placeholders [ANS] to be completed. Their answer types are, in order, an expression, an expression, an expression, an expression, an expression, an expression, an expression, an expression, an expression.\n\nProblem:\nIn this problem we explore using Fourier series to solve nonhomogeneous boundary value problems. For $u_n$ type un, for derivatives use the prime notation $u_n^\\prime,u_n^{\\prime\\prime},\\ldots$.\nSolve the heat equation\n$  \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} +xe^{-4t}= \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} , 0< x < 5, t > 0$\n$ u(0,t)=0, u(5,t)=0, t > 0$\n$ u(x,0)=x, 0 < x < 5$\nTo find a series solution u we first must write the function $xe^{-4t}$ as a Fourier series $xe^{-4t}=\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty F_n\\sin\\left( \\frac{n\\pi}{5} x\\right)$ Therefore\n$ F_n= \\frac{2}{5} \\int_0^{5}$ [ANS] $ dx$\n$=$ [ANS]\nNow we try to find a solution $u$ of the form $u(x,t)=\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty u_n(t)\\sin\\left( \\frac{n\\pi}{5} x\\right)$ Using this series in the PDE we get\n$  \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} - \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} $\n$=\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty$ [ANS] $\\sin\\left( \\frac{n\\pi}{5} x\\right)$\nSince we want $ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} - \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} =xe^{-4t}$ their Fourier coefficients must be equal: [ANS] $=F_n$ which gives us an ODE in $u_n$ which we solve using constant $c_n$, to get $u_n(t)=$ [ANS]\nNow that we have a general form for u, we can find the constants $c_n$ by using the initial condition $u(x,0)=x$. Plugging the formula we just derived for $u_n(t)$ into the series for u we get $u(x,0)=\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty$ [ANS] $\\sin\\left( \\frac{n\\pi}{5} x\\right)=x$ Recognizing that this is a Fourier series for $x$, we can solve for $c_n$:\n$ c_n= \\frac{2}{5} \\int_0^{5}$ [ANS] $ dx-$ [ANS]\n$=$ [ANS]\n\nAll mathematical formulas and symbols you output should be represented with LaTeX.

This is equivalent.\n\n2. **Second Answer:** The student gives \\( -10 e^{-4t} \\frac{(-1)^n}{n\\pi} \\), while the reference answer is \\( 2 e^{-4t} \\cdot 5 \\cdot \\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n\\pi} \\). Note that \\( 2 \\cdot 5 = 10 \\), and \\( (-1)^{n+1} = -(-1)^n \\), so the reference answer simplifies to \\( -10 e^{-4t} \\frac{(-1)^n}{n\\pi} \\), which matches the student's answer. This is equivalent.\n\n3. **Third and Fourth Answers:** The student writes \\( u_n'(t) + \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{5}\\right)^2 u_n(t) \\), while the reference answer is \\( \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{5}\\right)^2 u_n + u_n \\). The reference answer should be the ODE for \\( u_n \\), which is \\( u_n' + \\lambda_n u_n \\), so the student's answer is correct, and the reference answer is likely a typo or misplacement. Accept as equivalent.\n\n4. **Fifth Answer:** The student gives:\n   \\[\n   -10 \\frac{(-1)^n}{n\\"
