In this case, the error is within the allowed margin, so the answer should be TRUE.\n\nHowever, the student rounded to two decimal places, while the reference answer is given to many more decimal places. If the problem required at least two decimal places, the student's answer would be acceptable. But if the problem required more precision, the answer would be incorrect.\n\nGiven the instructions and the calculated error, the student's answer is within the allowed tolerance. Therefore, the correct equivalence judgement is TRUE.\n\n**Correction:** The answer should be TRUE.\n\n## Equivalence Judgement\nTRUE\n\n## Justification\nThe student's answer for the formula, \\( 900 \\left(1.003\\right)^{12t} \\), is mathematically identical to the reference answer. For the numerical value after 100 months, the student's answer of \\( 1214.46 \\) is a rounded version of the reference answer \\( 1214.32744742984 \\). The relative error is less than \\( 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\), which is within the acceptable margin of error as specified in the instructions.

Final Judgement\n\nAlthough the student rounded the numerical answers to the nearest integer, the relative errors are within the allowed tolerance (\\( 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\)). The function form is mathematically equivalent. Therefore, the answers are equivalent.\n\n**Correction:** Upon review, the instructions state: \"The answer is FALSE even if the student's final answer almost correct with a minor mistakes. However, for numerical values or coefficients, the relative error within 1e-3 can be ignored.\" Since both numerical answers are within the allowed tolerance, the answer should be TRUE.\n\n## Equivalence Judgement\nTRUE\n\n## Justification\n\nThe student's answers are mathematically equivalent to the reference answers. The function form is correct, and the numerical answers are within the allowed relative error of \\( 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\). The order and format are also correct. Therefore, the student's answer is correct.\n\n=== report over ==="

However, for the specific value at \\( t = 20 \\), the student gives \\( 390.297 \\) while the reference answer is \\( 390.309 \\).\n\nCalculating the relative error:\n\\[\n\\frac{|390.297 - 390.309|}{390.309} \\approx 3.08 \\times 10^{-5}\n\\]\nThis is well within the allowed tolerance of \\( 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\).\n\nHowever, according to the instructions, the answer is considered FALSE even if there is a minor mistake, unless the relative error is within the specified tolerance. In this case, the error is within tolerance, so the answer should be TRUE.\n\nBut, to be consistent with the instructions, let's double-check the calculation:\n\n- \\( e^{-1} \\approx 0.3679 \\)\n- \\( 570 \\times 0.3679 = 209.703 \\)\n- \\( 600 - 209.703 = 390.297 \\)\n\nThe reference answer is \\( 390.309 \\), which suggests a slightly different value for \\( e^{-1} \\) was used (possibly more decimal places).\n\nGiven the relative error is much less than \\( 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\), the student's answer should be considered correct.\n\n## Correction to Equivalence Judgement\nTRUE\n\n## Justification (Revised)\nThe student's answer for the function \\( x(t) \\) is exactly the same as the reference answer. For the value at \\( t = 20 \\), the student's answer of \\( 390.297 \\) differs from the reference answer of \\( 390.309 \\) by a very small amount. The relative error is approximately \\( 3 \\times 10^{-5} \\), which is well within the allowed tolerance of \\( 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\). Therefore, the student's answer is mathematically equivalent to the reference answer.\n\n=== report over ==="

This is a notational difference, but the student's form is mathematically equivalent to the expanded form in the reference answer.\n     - The constant in front of \\( e^{-0.8t} \\) in the student's answer is \\( -25 + 14.63414634 = -10.36585366 \\), which matches the reference answer.\n\n   - Therefore, the general solution for \\( T(t) \\) is mathematically equivalent.\n\n3. **Minimum and maximum values:**\n   - The reference answer gives: \\( 76.25914857 \\) (min), \\( 113.74085143 \\) (max).\n   - The student gives: \\( 74 \\) (min), \\( 116 \\) (max).\n   - The student's values are rounded to the nearest integer, but the problem does not specify to round. The difference between the student's and reference values is more than the allowed relative error of \\( 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\).\n     - For the minimum: \\( |74 - 76.259| / 76.259 \\approx 0.0296 \\) (about 3%)\n     - For the maximum: \\( |116 - 113.741| / 113.741 \\approx 0.0199 \\) (about 2%)\n\n   - These errors are too large to be considered equivalent under the problem's guidelines.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the student correctly derived the general solution and the first three answers, the final minimum and maximum values are not within the required tolerance of the reference answer.

While these are numerically equivalent, the reference answer prefers the fractional form, but this alone would not be enough for a FALSE judgement if all else matched.\n\n3. **Laplace Transform Expression**: The most significant difference is in the final Laplace transform answer.

This is a substantial omission.\n\n4. **Order and Content**: The order of the answers matches, but the content does not. The student does not simplify or substitute the values as required by the reference answer.\n\n**Conclusion**: The student's answer does not capture the same meaning as the reference answer, primarily due to the lack of simplification, incorrect units, and the omission of the explicit Laplace transform.

Do NOT use $X^\\prime(x)$\nThe longitudinal displacement u(x,t) of a vibrating elastic bar can be modeled by a wave equation with free-end conditions\n a^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} , 0< x < L, t > 0   \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\Big\\vert_{x=0}=0,  \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\Big\\vert_{x=L}=0, t > 0  u(x,0)=x   \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} \\Big\\vert_{t=0}=2,0<x<L\nPART 1: Separate\nWe look for solutions of the form $u(x,t)=X(x)T(t)$. Assuming solutions of this form the PDE can be written as [ANS]=[ANS]\nThen we can separate the PDE,placing constants in the DE into T: [ANS]=[ANS]=$-\\lambda$ ($\\lambda$ is typed as lambda) The boundary conditions in the PDE translate into initial conditions for the differential equation in X: Since these differential equations are independent of each other, they can be separated DE in X: [ANS] $=0$ IC's in X:\n$X^\\prime($ [ANS] $)=$ [ANS]\n$X^\\prime($ [ANS] $)=$ [ANS]\nDE in T: [ANS] $=0$\nThis leads us to a Sturm-Louiville problem in X. In each case the general solution in X is written with constants A and B.\nPART 2: Solve for X\nCase 1: $\\lambda=0$ $X(x)=$ [ANS]\nUsing this formula\n$X^\\prime(0)=$ [ANS] $=0$ $X^\\prime(L)=$ [ANS] $=0$ Making X a constant function. We get the constant solution another way, so we will discard this case.\nCase 2: $\\lambda=-\\alpha^2$ $X(x)=$ [ANS]\n$X^\\prime(0)=$ [ANS] $=0$ That simplifies X down to [ANS]. Using the simplified X: $X^\\prime(L)=$ [ANS] $=0$\nTherefore $A=$ [ANS] and $X=$ [ANS]\nCase 3: $\\lambda=\\alpha^2$ $X(x)=$ [ANS]\n$X^\\prime(0)=$ [ANS] $=0$ So X simplifies to [ANS]. Using the simplified X: $X^\\prime(L)=$ [ANS] $=0$ Which leads us to the eigenvalues $\\lambda=$ [ANS]\nNote If n=0 we get the constant case from $\\lambda=0$, including it would have been redundant.\nPART 3: Solve for T\nSo the only case we need consider is the $\\lambda=\\alpha^2$ case. Therefore the differential equation in T is now [ANS] $=0$ which has the general solution (using C and D as the unknown constants) $T=$ [ANS]\nPART 4: Find the series solution\nSince the constant from the $\\cos\\!\\left( \\frac{n\\pi x}{L} \\right)$ term would be redundant, functions of the form $u(x,t)=X(x)T(t)=$ [ANS], for $n\\geq 0$, are solutions of the PDE  a^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} , 0< x < L, t > 0   \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\Big\\vert_{x=0}=0,  \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\Big\\vert_{x=L}=0, t > 0 To add in the initial conditions we will have to use a series solution.

The student includes extra factors of $k$ in the arguments, which is not present in the reference answer.\n   - Similarly, for the trigonometric case, the student writes $a \\cos(\\frac{\\alpha}{k} x) + b \\sin(\\frac{\\alpha}{k} x)$, while the reference answer is $a \\cos(\\alpha x) + b \\sin(\\alpha x)$.\n\n3. **Exponential Solutions**:  \n   - The student writes $c e^{\\frac{\\lambda}{7} y^{-7}}$, while the reference answer is $c e^{\\frac{\\lambda k^2}{7} y^{-7}}$. The $k^2$ factor is missing in the exponent in the student's answer.\n   - For the final forms, the student writes $c [a \\cosh(\\frac{\\alpha}{k} x) + b \\sinh(\\frac{\\alpha}{k} x)] e^{-\\frac{\\alpha^2}{7} y^{-7}}$, while the reference answer is $"

Population Formula\n\n- **Reference:** \\( 20000 \\cdot 7^{t/100} \\)\n- **Student:** \\( P(t) = 20000 e^{\\left(\\frac{\\ln 7}{100}\\right)t} \\)\n\nThese are mathematically equivalent, since \\( e^{(\\ln 7)t/100} = 7^{t/100} \\). So, the first part is correct.\n\n### 2. Time to Reach 200,000\n\n- **Reference:** \\( 118.329466245494 \\)\n- **Student:** \\( 118 \\)\n\nThe student rounded the answer to the nearest integer, while the reference answer is a more precise decimal. The relative error is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{118 - 118.329466245494}{118.329466245494} \\approx -0.00278\n\\]\n\nThis is a relative error of about \\( 2.8 \\times 10^{-3} \\), which exceeds the allowed tolerance of \\( 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\). Therefore, this part is not sufficiently accurate.\n\n### 3. Rate of Change at \\( t = 350 \\)\n\n- **Reference:** \\( 353179.850906081 \\)\n- **Student:** \\( 35319 \\)\n\nThe student\u2019s answer is off by a factor of 10 (likely a calculation or transcription error). The relative error is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{35319 - 353179.850906081}{353179.850906081} \\approx -0.900\n\\]\n\nThis is a significant error and not within the allowed tolerance.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the first part is correct, the second and third parts do not meet the required precision or accuracy. Therefore, the overall answer is **not equivalent** to the reference answer.\n\n=== report over ==="

However, the instructions also state: \"If there are multiple answers, pay attention to the order of these answers according to the problem. If the order matters for the problem, student final answer that has a different order as the reference answer should be regarded as FALSE.\" In this case, the order is correct.\n\nTherefore, since both answers are in the correct order and the numerical value is within the allowed tolerance, the student's answer is correct.\n\n## Correction to Equivalence Judgement\nTRUE\n\n## Justification (Revised)\nThe student's answer for the general solution, \\( 200 - 185 e^{-t/50} \\), is exactly the same as the reference answer. For the value at \\( t = 30 \\), the student provides \\( 98.5 \\), which is a rounded value of the reference answer \\( 98.4698 \\). The relative error is less than \\( 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\), which is within the allowed margin of error for numerical answers.

The reference answer uses a different amplitude and frequency (cosine with \\( 4\\pi t \\)), and includes a constant offset.

The forms are not equivalent.\n\n5. **Amount in January 2000 (\\( t=10 \\))**:  \n   - Student: \\( 1714 \\)\n   - Reference: \\( 12181.9247740871 \\)\n   \n   The values are not close; the student's answer is off by an order of magnitude, indicating a significant error in the model or calculation.\n\n6. **Steady-State Solution**:  \n   - Student: \\( A \\cos(2\\pi t) + B \\sin(2\\pi t) \\)\n   - Reference: \\( -\\frac{850}{0.04} - 0.271031 \\cos(4\\pi t) + 85.147 \\sin(4\\pi t) \\)\n   \n   The student gives a general form with undetermined coefficients and the wrong frequency, while the reference answer gives a specific, fully determined solution with the correct frequency and a constant term.\n\n7. **Final Value**:  \n   - Both answers give \\( 3 \\). This is correct.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe student only matches the reference answer in the first and last parts. For all other parts, the student uses a different model (wrong frequency, missing constant offset, undetermined coefficients), and the numerical answers do not match.

Here are the main discrepancies:\n\n1. **Order and Content of Early Entries:**  \n   - The reference answer begins with \\(0, 3, 9 e^{-st}, 3, \\infty, 3 t e^{-st}, 3 t, \\ldots\\), while the student's answer starts with \\(9, 0, 3, 3, 3, \\infty, t e^{-st}, t, \\ldots\\). The order and the specific expressions do not align.\n   - For example, the reference answer's third entry is \\(9 e^{-st}\\), but the student's is \\(3\\).\n\n2. **Missing or Incorrect Multiplicative Constants:**  \n   - The reference answer often includes multiplicative constants (such as \\(3\\) or \\(9\\)) in front of terms like \\(e^{-st}\\) or \\(dt\\), which are missing or misplaced in the student's answer. For instance, the reference answer has \\(3 t e^{-st}\\) and \\(3 t\\), but the student writes \\(t e^{-st}\\) and \\(t\\) without the factor of 3.\n\n3. **Integration Limits and Expressions:**  \n   - The reference answer uses expressions like \\(-\\frac{9}{s} e^{-st}\\) and \\(\\frac{3 t e^{-st}}{s}\\), while the student writes \\(-\\frac{1}{s} e^{-st}\\) and \\(t e^{-st}\\), missing the necessary coefficients.\n\n4. **Final Laplace Transform Expression:**  \n   - The reference answer's final boxed entry is \\(\\frac{9}{s} + e^{-3s} \\left[ -\\frac{9}{s} + \\frac{9}{s} + \\frac{3}{s^2} \\right]\\), which simplifies to \\(\\frac{9}{s} + \\frac{3}{s^2} e^{-3s}\\). The student writes \\(\\frac{9}{s} + \\frac{3}{s^2} e^{-3s}\\), which is correct for the final value, but the process and intermediate boxed answers do not match the reference answer's required sequence.\n\n5. **Order and Structure:**  \n   - The reference answer is structured to match the step-by-step process of the Laplace transform calculation, with each boxed answer corresponding to a specific step. The student's answer does not follow this structure and order, making it notationally and mathematically non-equ"

Since \\( e^3 \\approx 20.0855 \\), these are mathematically equivalent expressions for the exact solution. The difference in form is acceptable.\n\n3. **Error Calculations:**\n   - The student\u2019s error values are \\( 0.00423, 0.00721, 0.00884 \\), while the reference answer gives \\( 0.00198767, 0.00584558, 0.00930269 \\).

The most significant error is in the classification of the last equation, where the homogeneity is misidentified.\n\nTherefore, the student's answer is not equivalent to the reference answer.\n\n=== report over ==="

Here are the main discrepancies:\n\n1. **Notational and Variable Differences**: The reference answer uses simplified notations such as \\( X \\), \\( T \\), and omits explicit arguments (e.g., \\( X(x) \\) vs. \\( X \\)), while the student uses more explicit forms (e.g., \\( X(x)T(t) \\)). While this is not a problem in itself, the reference answer also omits derivatives in some places, whereas the student includes them (e.g., \\( a^2 X''(x)T(t) \\) vs. \\( a^2 X \\)). This is a notational mismatch.\n\n2. **Boundary/Initial Conditions**: The reference answer includes values like \\( L \\) and \\( T \\) for certain boundary/initial conditions, but the student writes \\( 0 \\) in those places. For example, for [ANS 8] and [ANS 9], the reference answer is \\( L \\) and \\( 0 \\), but the student writes \\( 0 \\) for both. This is a substantive mathematical difference.\n\n3. **General Solution Forms**: For the general solution in the case \\( \\lambda = -\\alpha^2 \\), the reference answer uses hyperbolic functions (\\( \\cosh \\), \\( \\sinh \\)), while the student writes the solution in terms of exponentials and only later simplifies to hyperbolic functions. However, the boxed answer for [ANS 15] is \\("

If the problem required answers to at least four significant digits, the student's answer would be considered incorrect.\n\n**In summary:** The student's answer is close but does not meet the expected precision as indicated by the reference answer, so the answer is marked as FALSE.\n\n=== report over ==="

This is a minor rounding, but the problem statement does not specify the required precision. However, the more significant issue is the form: the reference answer uses \\( 14.09396(0.7\\sin(t) - \\cos(t)) \\), while the student splits this as \\( 14.09\\sin(t) - 14.09\\cos(t) \\). This is only equivalent if \\( 0.7\\sin(t) - \\cos(t) = \\sin(t) - \\cos(t) \\), which is not true. The correct expansion would be \\( 14.09396 \\times 0.7\\sin(t) - 14.09396\\cos(t) \\), i.e., \\( 9.866\\sin(t) - 14.09396\\cos(t) \\), not \\( 14.09\\sin(t) - 14.09\\cos(t) \\). Thus, the student's answer is not mathematically equivalent to the reference answer.\n\n3. **Long-term minimum and maximum:**\n   - The reference answer gives \\( 62.79613 \\) and \\( 97.20387 \\).\n   - The student gives \\( 60 \\) and \\( 100 \\).\n   - These are rough estimates and do not match the reference values within the required precision (the difference is more than 1e-3 relative error).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe student's answer is not mathematically or numerically equivalent to the reference answer in the general solution for \\( T(t) \\) and the long-term minimum and maximum values. The error in the trigonometric coefficients and the lack of precision in the extrema make the answer incorrect.\n\n=== report over ==="

However, even for \\(0 \\leq t < 1\\), the coefficient mismatch for the \\(\\sin 4t\\) term means the answers are not equivalent.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The first boxed answer (\\(Y(s)\\)) is equivalent to the reference answer.\n- The second"

The student's answer, while containing many correct expressions, does not match the order or the exact content of the reference answer. For example, the reference answer starts with the limits \\(0, 7\\) and the integrand \\(6 e^{-st}\\), while the student writes \\(6, 0^7, e^{-st}\\), which is a different order and format.\n\n2. **Coefficients and Expressions:** The reference answer includes coefficients with the integrands (e.g., \\(6 e^{-st}\\), \\(4 t e^{-st}\\)), while the student separates the coefficients and the integrands (e.g., \\(6, 0^7, e^{-st}\\)). This separation can lead to ambiguity and does not strictly follow the format of the reference answer.\n\n3. **Limits and Notation:** The reference answer uses clear notation for limits (e.g., \\(0, 7\\)), while the student uses \\(0^7\\), which is not standard and could be misinterpreted.\n\n4. **Final Expressions:** The final expressions in the reference answer are more compact and combine terms appropriately, such as \\(\\frac{6}{s} + e^{-7s} \\left( -\\frac{6}{s} + \\frac{28}{s} + \\frac{4}{s^2} \\right)\\), whereas the student writes \\(\\frac{6}{s} + \\frac{28}{s} e^{-7s} + \\frac{4}{s^2} e^{-7s}\\) and \\(\\frac{6}{s} + \\left( \\frac{22}{s} + \\frac{4}{s^2} \\right) e^{-7s}\\). While these are algebraically equivalent, the order and grouping do not match the reference answer's placeholders.\n\n5. **Missing or Extra Placeholders:** The student includes some expressions (e.g., \\(t, e^{-st} dt, dt\\)) that do not directly correspond to the reference answer's placeholders, and omits or rearranges others.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBecause the student's answer does not match the order, grouping, or exact content of the reference answer's placeholders, and because the problem requires precise matching of stepwise"

The correct steady-state ODE is \\(k S'' + 11 = 0\\), so the answer for the ODE itself should be \\(k S''\\), not \\(k S'' + 11\\).

The student\u2019s answer is incomplete.\n\n6. **Ninth Expression (\\(S(x)\\)):**  \n   Both answers match.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The student\u2019s answer is incomplete in several places (notably, the explicit formula for \\(b_n\\) is missing, and the sine factor in the initial condition for the Fourier series is omitted).\n- There is a notational error in the steady-state ODE.\n- While some expressions are equivalent, the missing details and errors mean the student\u2019s answer does not fully capture the meaning of the reference answer.\n\nTherefore, the student\u2019s answer is **not equivalent** to the reference answer.\n\n=== report over ==="

When solving DE in X and Y use the constants a and b for X and c for Y. The PDE can be rewritten using this solution as (placing constants in the DE for Y) into [ANS]=[ANS]=$-\\lambda$\nNote: Use the prime notation for derivatives, so the derivative of $X$ is written as $X^\\prime$. Do NOT use $X^\\prime(x)$\nSince these differential equations are independent of each other, they can be separated DE in X: [ANS] $=0$ DE in Y: [ANS] $=0$\nNow we solve the separate separated ODEs for the different cases in $\\lambda$. In each case the general solution in X is written with constants a and b and the general solution in Y is written with constants c and d. Write the functions alphabetically, so that if the solutions involve cos and sin, your answer would be acos(x)+bsin(x). Case 1: $\\lambda=0$ $X(x)=$ [ANS]\n$Y(y)=$ [ANS]\nDE in Y If $\\lambda\\neq 0$, the differential equation in Y is first order, linear, and more importantly separable. We separate the two sides as [ANS]=[ANS]\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $y$ (placing the constant of integration c in the right hand side) we get [ANS]=[ANS]\nSolving for Y, using the funny algebra of constant where $e^c=c$ is just another constant we get $Y=$ [ANS]\nFor $\\lambda\\neq 0$ we get a Sturm-Louiville problem in X which we need to handle two more cases Case 2: $\\lambda=-\\alpha^2$ $X(x)=$ [ANS]\nCase 3: $\\lambda=\\alpha^2$ $X(x)=$ [ANS]\nFinal Solution Case 1: $\\lambda=0$ $u=$ [ANS]\nCase 2: $\\lambda=-\\alpha^2$ $u=$ [ANS]\nCase 3: $\\lambda=\\alpha^2$ $u=$ [ANS]\n\nAll mathematical formulas and symbols you output should be represented with LaTeX.

For example, the reference answer has terms like \\( -\\frac{\\lambda k^2}{y^4} \\), \\( c e^{\\frac{\\lambda k^2}{3} y^{-3}} \\), and exponents such as \\( -\\frac{\\alpha^2 k^2}{3} y^{-3} \\).\n   - The student's answer omits these \\( k^2 \\) factors, using only \\( \\lambda \\) or \\( \\alpha \\) in the exponents and coefficients. This is a significant mathematical difference, as the presence of \\( k^2 \\) changes the scaling and behavior of the solutions.\n\n2. **Hyperbolic vs. Exponential/Circular Functions:**  \n   - The reference answer uses hyperbolic functions (\\( \\cosh \\), \\( \\sinh \\)) for the case \\( \\lambda = -\\alpha^2 \\), while the student uses exponentials (\\( e^{\\frac{\\alpha}{k} x} \\)), which is mathematically equivalent. However, the argument of the exponentials in the student's answer is \\( \\frac{\\alpha}{k} x \\), while the reference answer uses \\( \\alpha x \\). This is only equivalent if \\( \\alpha \\) is redefined, but the reference answer's notation is more consistent with the separation constant as \\( \\lambda = -\\alpha^2 k^2 \\).\n   - Similarly, for the trigonometric case, the student uses \\( \\frac{\\alpha}{k} x \\) instead of \\( \\alpha x \\).\n\n3. **Order and Notation:**  \n   - The order of the answers is mostly consistent, but the notational differences (especially the missing \\( k^2 \\) factors) are not minor; they fundamentally change the form and correctness of the separated solutions.\n\n4. **Constants and Integration:**  \n   - The reference answer uses \\( \\ln|Y| \\) and \\( -\\frac{\\lambda k^2}{-3} y^{-3} + C \\), while the student uses \\( \\ln Y \\) and \\( \\int -\\frac{\\lambda}{y^4"
