In this case, the error is within the allowed margin, so the answer should be TRUE.\n\nHowever, the student rounded to two decimal places, while the reference answer is given to many more decimal places. If the problem required at least two decimal places, the student's answer would be acceptable. But if the problem required more precision, the answer would be incorrect.\n\nGiven the instructions and the calculated error, the student's answer is within the allowed tolerance. Therefore, the correct equivalence judgement is TRUE.\n\n**Correction:** The answer should be TRUE.\n\n## Equivalence Judgement\nTRUE\n\n## Justification\nThe student's answer for the formula, \\( 900 \\left(1.003\\right)^{12t} \\), is mathematically identical to the reference answer. For the numerical value after 100 months, the student's answer of \\( 1214.46 \\) is a rounded version of the reference answer \\( 1214.32744742984 \\). The relative error is less than \\( 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\), which is within the acceptable margin of error as specified in the instructions.

Final Judgement\n\nAlthough the student rounded the numerical answers to the nearest integer, the relative errors are within the allowed tolerance (\\( 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\)). The function form is mathematically equivalent. Therefore, the answers are equivalent.\n\n**Correction:** Upon review, the instructions state: \"The answer is FALSE even if the student's final answer almost correct with a minor mistakes. However, for numerical values or coefficients, the relative error within 1e-3 can be ignored.\" Since both numerical answers are within the allowed tolerance, the answer should be TRUE.\n\n## Equivalence Judgement\nTRUE\n\n## Justification\n\nThe student's answers are mathematically equivalent to the reference answers. The function form is correct, and the numerical answers are within the allowed relative error of \\( 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\). The order and format are also correct. Therefore, the student's answer is correct.\n\n=== report over ==="

However, for the specific value at \\( t = 20 \\), the student gives \\( 390.297 \\) while the reference answer is \\( 390.309 \\).\n\nCalculating the relative error:\n\\[\n\\frac{|390.297 - 390.309|}{390.309} \\approx 3.08 \\times 10^{-5}\n\\]\nThis is well within the allowed tolerance of \\( 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\).\n\nHowever, according to the instructions, the answer is considered FALSE even if there is a minor mistake, unless the relative error is within the specified tolerance. In this case, the error is within tolerance, so the answer should be TRUE.\n\nBut, to be consistent with the instructions, let's double-check the calculation:\n\n- \\( e^{-1} \\approx 0.3679 \\)\n- \\( 570 \\times 0.3679 = 209.703 \\)\n- \\( 600 - 209.703 = 390.297 \\)\n\nThe reference answer is \\( 390.309 \\), which suggests a slightly different value for \\( e^{-1} \\) was used (possibly more decimal places).\n\nGiven the relative error is much less than \\( 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\), the student's answer should be considered correct.\n\n## Correction to Equivalence Judgement\nTRUE\n\n## Justification (Revised)\nThe student's answer for the function \\( x(t) \\) is exactly the same as the reference answer. For the value at \\( t = 20 \\), the student's answer of \\( 390.297 \\) differs from the reference answer of \\( 390.309 \\) by a very small amount. The relative error is approximately \\( 3 \\times 10^{-5} \\), which is well within the allowed tolerance of \\( 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\). Therefore, the student's answer is mathematically equivalent to the reference answer.\n\n=== report over ==="

This is a notational difference, but the student's form is mathematically equivalent to the expanded form in the reference answer.\n     - The constant in front of \\( e^{-0.8t} \\) in the student's answer is \\( -25 + 14.63414634 = -10.36585366 \\), which matches the reference answer.\n\n   - Therefore, the general solution for \\( T(t) \\) is mathematically equivalent.\n\n3. **Minimum and maximum values:**\n   - The reference answer gives: \\( 76.25914857 \\) (min), \\( 113.74085143 \\) (max).\n   - The student gives: \\( 74 \\) (min), \\( 116 \\) (max).\n   - The student's values are rounded to the nearest integer, but the problem does not specify to round. The difference between the student's and reference values is more than the allowed relative error of \\( 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\).\n     - For the minimum: \\( |74 - 76.259| / 76.259 \\approx 0.0296 \\) (about 3%)\n     - For the maximum: \\( |116 - 113.741| / 113.741 \\approx 0.0199 \\) (about 2%)\n\n   - These errors are too large to be considered equivalent under the problem's guidelines.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the student correctly derived the general solution and the first three answers, the final minimum and maximum values are not within the required tolerance of the reference answer.

While these are numerically equivalent, the reference answer prefers the fractional form, but this alone would not be enough for a FALSE judgement if all else matched.\n\n3. **Laplace Transform Expression**: The most significant difference is in the final Laplace transform answer.

This is a substantial omission.\n\n4. **Order and Content**: The order of the answers matches, but the content does not. The student does not simplify or substitute the values as required by the reference answer.\n\n**Conclusion**: The student's answer does not capture the same meaning as the reference answer, primarily due to the lack of simplification, incorrect units, and the omission of the explicit Laplace transform.

Do NOT use $X^\\prime(x)$\nThe longitudinal displacement u(x,t) of a vibrating elastic bar can be modeled by a wave equation with free-end conditions\n a^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} , 0< x < L, t > 0   \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\Big\\vert_{x=0}=0,  \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\Big\\vert_{x=L}=0, t > 0  u(x,0)=x   \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} \\Big\\vert_{t=0}=2,0<x<L\nPART 1: Separate\nWe look for solutions of the form $u(x,t)=X(x)T(t)$. Assuming solutions of this form the PDE can be written as [ANS]=[ANS]\nThen we can separate the PDE,placing constants in the DE into T: [ANS]=[ANS]=$-\\lambda$ ($\\lambda$ is typed as lambda) The boundary conditions in the PDE translate into initial conditions for the differential equation in X: Since these differential equations are independent of each other, they can be separated DE in X: [ANS] $=0$ IC's in X:\n$X^\\prime($ [ANS] $)=$ [ANS]\n$X^\\prime($ [ANS] $)=$ [ANS]\nDE in T: [ANS] $=0$\nThis leads us to a Sturm-Louiville problem in X. In each case the general solution in X is written with constants A and B.\nPART 2: Solve for X\nCase 1: $\\lambda=0$ $X(x)=$ [ANS]\nUsing this formula\n$X^\\prime(0)=$ [ANS] $=0$ $X^\\prime(L)=$ [ANS] $=0$ Making X a constant function. We get the constant solution another way, so we will discard this case.\nCase 2: $\\lambda=-\\alpha^2$ $X(x)=$ [ANS]\n$X^\\prime(0)=$ [ANS] $=0$ That simplifies X down to [ANS]. Using the simplified X: $X^\\prime(L)=$ [ANS] $=0$\nTherefore $A=$ [ANS] and $X=$ [ANS]\nCase 3: $\\lambda=\\alpha^2$ $X(x)=$ [ANS]\n$X^\\prime(0)=$ [ANS] $=0$ So X simplifies to [ANS]. Using the simplified X: $X^\\prime(L)=$ [ANS] $=0$ Which leads us to the eigenvalues $\\lambda=$ [ANS]\nNote If n=0 we get the constant case from $\\lambda=0$, including it would have been redundant.\nPART 3: Solve for T\nSo the only case we need consider is the $\\lambda=\\alpha^2$ case. Therefore the differential equation in T is now [ANS] $=0$ which has the general solution (using C and D as the unknown constants) $T=$ [ANS]\nPART 4: Find the series solution\nSince the constant from the $\\cos\\!\\left( \\frac{n\\pi x}{L} \\right)$ term would be redundant, functions of the form $u(x,t)=X(x)T(t)=$ [ANS], for $n\\geq 0$, are solutions of the PDE  a^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} , 0< x < L, t > 0   \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\Big\\vert_{x=0}=0,  \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\Big\\vert_{x=L}=0, t > 0 To add in the initial conditions we will have to use a series solution.

The student includes extra factors of $k$ in the arguments, which is not present in the reference answer.\n   - Similarly, for the trigonometric case, the student writes $a \\cos(\\frac{\\alpha}{k} x) + b \\sin(\\frac{\\alpha}{k} x)$, while the reference answer is $a \\cos(\\alpha x) + b \\sin(\\alpha x)$.\n\n3. **Exponential Solutions**:  \n   - The student writes $c e^{\\frac{\\lambda}{7} y^{-7}}$, while the reference answer is $c e^{\\frac{\\lambda k^2}{7} y^{-7}}$. The $k^2$ factor is missing in the exponent in the student's answer.\n   - For the final forms, the student writes $c [a \\cosh(\\frac{\\alpha}{k} x) + b \\sinh(\\frac{\\alpha}{k} x)] e^{-\\frac{\\alpha^2}{7} y^{-7}}$, while the reference answer is $"
