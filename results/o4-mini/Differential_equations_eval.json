When solving DE in X and Y use the constants a and b for X and c for Y. The PDE can be rewritten using this solution as (placing constants in the DE for Y) into [ANS]=[ANS]=$-\\lambda$\nNote: Use the prime notation for derivatives, so the derivative of $X$ is written as $X^\\prime$. Do NOT use $X^\\prime(x)$\nSince these differential equations are independent of each other, they can be separated DE in X: [ANS] $=0$ DE in Y: [ANS] $=0$\nNow we solve the separate separated ODEs for the different cases in $\\lambda$. In each case the general solution in X is written with constants a and b and the general solution in Y is written with constants c and d. Write the functions alphabetically, so that if the solutions involve cos and sin, your answer would be acos(x)+bsin(x). Case 1: $\\lambda=0$ $X(x)=$ [ANS]\n$Y(y)=$ [ANS]\nDE in Y If $\\lambda\\neq 0$, the differential equation in Y is first order, linear, and more importantly separable. We separate the two sides as [ANS]=[ANS]\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $y$ (placing the constant of integration c in the right hand side) we get [ANS]=[ANS]\nSolving for Y, using the funny algebra of constant where $e^c=c$ is just another constant we get $Y=$ [ANS]\nFor $\\lambda\\neq 0$ we get a Sturm-Louiville problem in X which we need to handle two more cases Case 2: $\\lambda=-\\alpha^2$ $X(x)=$ [ANS]\nCase 3: $\\lambda=\\alpha^2$ $X(x)=$ [ANS]\nFinal Solution Case 1: $\\lambda=0$ $u=$ [ANS]\nCase 2: $\\lambda=-\\alpha^2$ $u=$ [ANS]\nCase 3: $\\lambda=\\alpha^2$ $u=$ [ANS]\n\nAll mathematical formulas and symbols you output should be represented with LaTeX.

For the differential equation in T use the C and D.For the variable $\\lambda$ type the word lambda and type alpha for $\\alpha$,otherwise treat them as you would any other variable.\nUse the prime notation for derivatives, so the derivative of $X$ is written as $X^\\prime$. Do NOT use $X^\\prime(x)$\nThe longitudinal displacement u(x,t) of a vibrating elastic bar can be modeled by a wave equation with free-end conditions\n a^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} , 0< x < L, t > 0   \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\Big\\vert_{x=0}=0,  \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\Big\\vert_{x=L}=0, t > 0  u(x,0)=x   \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} \\Big\\vert_{t=0}=-3,0<x<L\nPART 1: Separate\nWe look for solutions of the form $u(x,t)=X(x)T(t)$. Assuming solutions of this form the PDE can be written as [ANS]=[ANS]\nThen we can separate the PDE,placing constants in the DE into T: [ANS]=[ANS]=$-\\lambda$ ($\\lambda$ is typed as lambda) The boundary conditions in the PDE translate into initial conditions for the differential equation in X: Since these differential equations are independent of each other, they can be separated DE in X: [ANS] $=0$ IC's in X:\n$X^\\prime($ [ANS] $)=$ [ANS]\n$X^\\prime($ [ANS] $)=$ [ANS]\nDE in T: [ANS] $=0$\nThis leads us to a Sturm-Louiville problem in X. In each case the general solution in X is written with constants A and B.\nPART 2: Solve for X\nCase 1: $\\lambda=0$ $X(x)=$ [ANS]\nUsing this formula\n$X^\\prime(0)=$ [ANS] $=0$ $X^\\prime(L)=$ [ANS] $=0$ Making X a constant function. We get the constant solution another way, so we will discard this case.\nCase 2: $\\lambda=-\\alpha^2$ $X(x)=$ [ANS]\n$X^\\prime(0)=$ [ANS] $=0$ That simplifies X down to [ANS]. Using the simplified X: $X^\\prime(L)=$ [ANS] $=0$\nTherefore $A=$ [ANS] and $X=$ [ANS]\nCase 3: $\\lambda=\\alpha^2$ $X(x)=$ [ANS]\n$X^\\prime(0)=$ [ANS] $=0$ So X simplifies to [ANS]. Using the simplified X: $X^\\prime(L)=$ [ANS] $=0$ Which leads us to the eigenvalues $\\lambda=$ [ANS]\nNote If n=0 we get the constant case from $\\lambda=0$, including it would have been redundant.\nPART 3: Solve for T\nSo the only case we need consider is the $\\lambda=\\alpha^2$ case. Therefore the differential equation in T is now [ANS] $=0$ which has the general solution (using C and D as the unknown constants) $T=$ [ANS]\nPART 4: Find the series solution\nSince the constant from the $\\cos\\!\\left( \\frac{n\\pi x}{L} \\right)$ term would be redundant, functions of the form $u(x,t)=X(x)T(t)=$ [ANS], for $n\\geq 0$, are solutions of the PDE  a^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} , 0< x < L, t > 0   \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\Big\\vert_{x=0}=0,  \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\Big\\vert_{x=L}=0, t > 0 To add in the initial conditions we will have to use a series solution.
